# Getting Started With Developing
#### Everyday Project Packaging With pyproject.toml

This is the code conversation between Ian Currie and Geir Arne Hjelle from [Real Python](https://realpython.com).  The first 3 recordings are available for free the remained does require a paid subscription


## 1. Introduction
I will attempt to create and tag a release in this project at the end of each video. I recommend you follow their videos and only peek at my code if you get stuck.

#### Notes
I added README.md to the project to make it easier to find the videos.  I also added a .gitignore file to ignore files not needed in the [GitHub](https://github.com/glnnlhmn/snakesay) Repo.
